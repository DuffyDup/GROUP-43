Website Guide: 

The homepage allows users to navigate different sections of the website through the navigation bar and footer.

Signing up via the Customer Sign-Up or Admin Sign-Up pages grants access to additional features. Customers can place orders, while admins can view and edit order statuses through the Process Order page. Admin registration requires a specific access code: Admin2024.

Admins can add, remove, and adjust stock quantities, as well as modify prices on the Manage Inventory page. They can also create, remove, and edit user accounts via the User Management page.

On the Reports and Analysis page, admins can download reports on top-selling products, detailed sales data from the last 30 days, market figures, and an Excel sheet containing sales insights.

Customers can add products to their cart and proceed to checkout. Once an order is completed, customers with an account can leave product reviews. They can also receive notifications about stock updates and newly added products. Additionally, customers can review their order history and leave feedback on the My Orders page.

All users can browse products and explore the website, but placing an order requires signing up or logging into a TechNova account.

Users can contact the TechNova team via a contact form, which is submitted for inquiries or any issues. These submissions are sent directly to the company's email.

If a customer wishes to return an item, they must complete and submit the Contact Us form to initiate the process.
